        <h3>AI & ML</h3>
      <p>
        Generative AI, self-hosted models, and machine learning from scratch.
        From neural networks to agentic frameworks, I prefer to build my own
        minimal and hyperspecific tooling to have maximum control.
      </p>

    <div class="interest-card">
      <h3>Tool & Test Driven Development</h3>
      <p>
        Creating focused, maintainable tooling that enable developers to work faster and safer. I advocate for tooling first, rather than later which I frequently refer to as the "fly-wheel" effect.
      </p>

    <div class="interest-card">
      <h3>Data</h3>
      <p>
        Synthetic data generation for NLP, computer vision, and OCR. Creating
        robust datasets from scratch. In some cases, this builds on my passion
        for 3D rendering.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="interest-card">
      <h3>DevOps & Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        Orchestration, Proxmox, Docker, Kubernetes, reverse proxies, and
        self-hosted DevOps pipelines. I am a part-time sysadmin with my own
        dedicated 18U cluster.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="interest-card">
      <h3>Web & Frontend</h3>
      <p>
        Static site generation, lightweight frameworks like HTMX and Svelte—the
        alternatives to the mainstream. While I still work with Next.js and a
        bit of Angular in the office, I tend to only introduce them when
        necessary.
      </p>

    <div class="interest-card">
      <h3>Systems Programming</h3>
      <p>
        Niche languages, rewrites in Rust (a bit cliche, I know), performance
        optimization, and language design exploration. From building my own
        bundlers to late nights with Rust and Go, I love a break to get
        low-level.
