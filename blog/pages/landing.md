    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This is a collection of notes and essays on software engineering, systems design, and the tools we build. I write about practical problems, elegant solutions, and the ideas that fascinate me—from AI and infrastructure to language design and developer tooling.</p>
    <p>Most posts explore patterns I've encountered in production systems or experiments I'm conducting with new technologies. Expect deep dives into real challenges, not surface-level tutorials.</p>
