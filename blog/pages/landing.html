      Hello, my name is Harry. I am a full-stack engineer by trade with passion
      for tech both code and non-code. The majority of my time currently is
      spent with Python and TypeScript, but I am looking for an opportunity to
      get back into Golang and work with Zig. Despite being classically trained,
      and self-taught, a Software Engineer, I have a vast interest in a wide
      array of other topics. Check out
      <a href="/interests.html">my interests</a>.

      Nowadays, I rarely publish FOSS tools I build, but I am trying to get back
      into it with very focused and tailored solutions that attempt to solve, or better
      understand the issues I face day-to-day. A lot of my workdays tend to be filled with highly complex & robust solutions, so in my free-time, I prefer the back-to-basics and KISS philosophies.
