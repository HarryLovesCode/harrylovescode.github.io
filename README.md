# Blurg

A blog with a custom static-site generator based on the lovely: [Carl Öst Wilkens´ Blog](https://ostwilkens.se/). It tweaks a few things, but does not deviate a whole lot.

Main changes are:

- Mermaid enabled
- File-watching
- Hot-reloading
- Basic front-matter support
- Images (and image resize, compression as Webp)

```
LIVE_RELOAD=1 uv run main.py
