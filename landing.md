Hello, my name is Harry. I am a full-stack engineer by trade with a passion for tech both code and non-code. The majority of my time currently is spent with Python and TypeScript, but I am looking for an opportunity to get back into Golang.

I like to make things go fast. From GenAI to computer vision, homelab to compilers, web servers to mobile apps. Nothing is safe from going brr.
