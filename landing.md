Hello, my name is Harry. I am a full-stack engineer by trade with passion for tech both code and non-code. The majority of my time currently is spent with Python and TypeScript, but I am looking for an opportunity to get back into Golang and work with Zig.

Despite being classically trained, and self-taught, a Software Engineer, I have a vast interest in a wide array of other topics including, but not limited to:

- Generative AI (primarily small, self-hosted models /r/localllama)
- Synthetic Data Generation (Both text and image for NLP, Object detection, and OCR)
- Machine Learning (mostly from scratch, no frameworks as self-learning)
- Static site generation, doing a lot with a little
- HTMX, Svelte, the un-Reacts of the world
- Reverse proxies, Proxmox, Docker, Kubernetes, and the bunch
- Niche programming languages, rewriting things in Rust
- Orchestration, pipelines, "self-hosted DevOps"

I like implementing the status quo with less resources, better tooling, and a more developer-centric workflow. Nowadays, I barely publish FOSS tools I build, but I am trying to get back into it with very focused solutions that attempt to solve, or better understand the issues I face day-to-day.
